        <h1>Welcome to My Personal Website</h1>
        <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Ibe Ezenwa Augustine</strong>, but I like to go by <strong>Austin Ibe</strong>. I am a software engineer currently based in Port Harcourt, Nigeria.</p>
        <p>
          My professional journey began in the Maritime and Oil & Gas sectors after graduating from Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH) in 2004. I started working in the oil and gas industry as a terminal depot at Apapa, Lagos, Nigeria, serving as a depot representative in 2008.
        </p>
        <p>
          Driven by my flair for marketing, I transitioned into a sales role after achieving a significant sales milestone. My employer then, Cee Cee Global, was amazed to discover I made the highest sales among all sales reps at that time, which led to my promotion from depot representative to sales officer.
        </p>
        <p>
          This opportunity in the oil and gas industry allowed me to explore upstream, midstream, and downstream segments. My curiosity and passion for the industry motivated me to pursue self-study and training to deepen my understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2013, I established Sunpet Global Enterprises, registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission of Nigeria.
