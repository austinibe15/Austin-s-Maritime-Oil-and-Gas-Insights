Unlocking Opportunities in Nigeria’s Oil & Gas Sector
Nigeria stands as a powerhouse in Africa’s oil and gas industry, with immense potential for exploration, production, and export. As the largest producer on the continent, Nigeria offers numerous opportunities for local and foreign investors to contribute to its economic growth.

The Different Streams of Oil and Gas Business
Nigeria’s oil and gas sector spans several key streams:

Upstream Operations: Exploration, drilling, and production of crude oil and natural gas.
Midstream: Transportation, storage, and processing of hydrocarbons.
Downstream: Refining, distribution, marketing, and sales of petroleum products.
Oilfield Services: Equipment supply, drilling services, and technical support.
Each stream is vital, creating a comprehensive ecosystem for oil and gas business operations in Nigeria.

Premium Products From Nigeria’s Oil & Gas Sector
Bonny Light Crude Oil
Originating from the Niger Delta region, Bonny Light is Nigeria’s flagship crude oil. Known for its high quality, it’s a light, sweet crude oil with low sulfur content, highly valued in international markets. Nigeria’s reputation as a reliable supplier stems from the consistent production and export of Bonny Light.

Automated Gas Oil (AGO)
A key product in Nigeria’s downstream sector, Automated Gas Oil (AGO) is used primarily as diesel fuel for vehicles, industrial machinery, and power generation. With Nigeria’s growing demand for transportation fuel, AGO remains a critical product in the country’s energy mix.

Premium Motor Spirit (PMS)
Commonly known as gasoline or petrol, PMS fuels Nigeria’s diverse transportation sector and power plants. The availability and quality of PMS are central to Nigeria’s daily economic activities.

Low Pour Fuel Oil (LPFO)
Used mostly for power generation and marine applications, Low Pour Fuel Oil is an essential heavy fuel oil product in Nigeria. Its demand is driven by the energy needs of industries and shipping.

Additional Key Petroleum Products
Dual Purpose Kerosene (DPK)
Dual Purpose Kerosene is a versatile fuel used primarily for cooking and heating in Nigerian households. It also has applications in the aviation sector, particularly as jet fuel in smaller aircraft operations. Its affordability and reliability make it vital for domestic energy needs and small-scale aviation.

Aviation Oil / Jet Fuel
A critical product for Nigeria’s expanding aviation industry, Aviation Oil or Jet Fuel supports domestic and international flights, connecting Nigeria to global markets. The growing aviation sector offers opportunities for investment in supply and distribution.

Doing Oil and Gas Business in Nigeria

Procedures for Purchasing Oil & Gas Products in Nigeria
Successfully acquiring crude oil and petroleum products such as BLCO, AGO, and others involves understanding the key processes that govern their transfer and sale within the Nigerian oil and gas sector. Here’s an overview of the most commonly used procedures:

1. CIF (Cost, Insurance, and Freight) Procedure
CIF remains a primary international trading term where the seller bears costs, insurance, and freight to deliver the product to the specified port.

How it works:
The seller handles shipping arrangements, insurance, and freight.
The buyer’s responsibility begins at port of arrival, including customs clearance.
Payment is often done via Standard Letter of Credit (Sblc) or other agreed terms.
Benefits:

Ease for the buyer due to seller-controlled logistics.
Clarity on total landed cost.

2. TTO (Tanker Take Over)
TTO is a process used to transfer ownership or possession of a petroleum product (like BLCO or AGO) from one tanker (ship) to another within Nigeria.

How it works:
The seller's tanker arrives at a designated Nigerian terminal.
An Authorized Tanker Take Over (TTO) process ensures transfer of products from the seller’s tanker to the buyer's storage tank.
Strict protocols and documentation (like transfer notes, barcode verification) are followed to ensure transparency and compliance.
Why it matters:
Ensures proper accountability.
Used chiefly in bulk crude and fuel transfers.

3. TTT (Tanker Take Over)
TTT (sometimes called "Tankering Transfer") follows similar procedures to TTO, emphasizing the safe and compliant transfer of liquids between tankers or from ships to storage facilities.

How it works:
The tanker designated to receive the product is authorized (by NNPC and regulators).
The transfer occurs under supervision, with detailed records.
The process confirms quality, volume, and adherence to safety standards.
Why it’s important:
Maintains product integrity.
Tracks the flow and accountability of petroleum shipments within Nigeria.

4. Other Common Procedures and Terms

FOB (Free On Board)
The seller ships the product onto the vessel at the port.
The buyer assumes risk and responsibility once goods pass the ship’s rail.



Summary Table of Key Procedures
| Procedure | Description | Use Cases | Responsibilities |  
|--------------|--------------|--------------|------------------|  
| CIF | Cost, Insurance, Freight | International trade | Seller manages shipment to port |  
| TTO | Tanker Take Over | Bulk transfer within Nigeria | Supervised transfer from tankers |  
| TTT | Tanker Take Over | Similar to TTO, detailed for specific transfers | Regulatory and accountability focus |  
| FOB | Free On Board | Export shipments | Buyer takes on shipping from port |  


Final Thoughts
Understanding these procedures helps facilitate smooth operations in Nigeria's dynamic oil and gas environment. Whether transferring products via TTO/TTT within Nigeria, or using CIF for international trade, engaging experienced logistics and legal partners can make these processes seamless.


Key Terms and Documents Necessary Before Purchasing Oil & Gas
Engaging in oil and gas transactions involves thorough preparation and proper documentation to ensure clarity, enforceability, and risk management. Here are the essential terms and documents to understand, including the Deed of Agreement (DoA) and Performance Bond (PB):

1. Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)
Definition:
A non-binding agreement that outlines the preliminary intentions of the parties to collaborate or proceed with negotiations.

Purpose:

To set out initial expectations and scope
To serve as a basis for drafting binding agreements like the DoA or SPA
To facilitate negotiations without creating legal obligations at this stage

2. Sales & Purchase Agreement (SPA)
Definition:
A legally binding contract clearly defining the sale terms, including product specifications, quantities, delivery schedules, payment terms, and responsibilities.

Purpose:

To formalize the transaction
To ensure enforceability of key contractual obligations
To protect both buyer and seller

3. Deed of Agreement (DoA)
Definition:
A comprehensive and binding legal document that records the obligations, commitments, and responsibilities of the involved parties for complex, long-term, or substantial transactions.

Purpose:

To define the detailed contractual framework
To govern ongoing obligations such as supply contracts, joint ventures, or licensing arrangements
To create enforceable commitments that go beyond a standard SPA

4. Performance Bond (PB)
Definition:
A Performance Bond is a financial guarantee issued by a bank or surety company, ensuring that a party (usually the seller or contractor) will fulfill their contractual obligations.

Purpose:

To provide security to the buyer that the seller will perform as agreed
To cover financial risks if the seller defaults or fails to deliver
Typically required before the commencement of shipment or delivery
How It Works:

The bank issues the PB on behalf of the seller, backed by collateral or guarantee
If the seller defaults, the buyer can claim against the bond for damages or compensation
The bond is usually released after successful completion of the contract
5. Additional Terms

Letter of Intent (LoI):
An initial, often non-binding document expressing intent to proceed.

Bank Guarantees / APG (Advance Payment Guarantee):
Instruments to secure payments upfront or performance.

Letter of Credit (LoC):
A bank’s commitment to pay upon conditions being met.

Inspection & QnQ:
Quality and Quantity inspection procedures before final payment, ensuring cargo accuracy and safety.

Why These Are Important
Proper documentation like the MoU, DoA, and especially the Performance Bond provides legal certainty and risk mitigation. The PB, in particular, enhances confidence by ensuring commitments are backed financially, minimizing risks of default.
