Nigeria’s Maritime Potential
Nigeria operates major ports like Lagos, Port Harcourt, and Onne, which handle thousands of containers and tons of cargo every year. These ports are the lifelines for Nigeria’s trade—to the rest of Africa and beyond.

The government is actively working to improve port operations, attract foreign investment, and modernize facilities. Private sector participation is growing, creating an environment ripe for new investments and collaborations.
